# CiteIt

CiteIt is a citation machine extension for Google Docs.

## How does it work?

Users first pick MLA or APA formats, then choose whether the works that they are citing are from a journal, website, newspaper, etc. and then input information such as title, authors, publisher, etc. and then have the correct formateed citation directly inserted into their google document.

## What language is it written in?

CiteIt is written in HTML and Google Apps Script which is essentially Javascript and some JQuery being used through the HTMLService.

## Can I download and use it?

Unfortunetly CiteIt is still under construction, while the source code will be updated in this Repo occasionally, eventually and hopefully CiteIt will be availble through the Google Docs extensions store (free for use).
